# Probability in Agriculture 🎲

Understanding probability distributions helps us model agricultural phenomena.

## Normal Distribution

```{r normal_dist}
# Simulate plant heights (normally distributed)
set.seed(123)
plant_heights <- rnorm(100, mean = 30, sd = 5)

# Plot histogram
hist(plant_heights, 
     main = "Distribution of Plant Heights",
     xlab = "Height (cm)",
     col = "lightblue",
     breaks = 15)

# Add normal curve
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 30, sd = 5) * 100 * 2, 
      add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

## Binomial Distribution - Seed Germination

```{r binomial}
# Probability of seed germination
germination_rate <- 0.85
n_seeds <- 20

# Simulate germination
germinated <- rbinom(1000, size = n_seeds, prob = germination_rate)

# Plot results
hist(germinated,
     main = "Number of Seeds Germinated (out of 20)",
     xlab = "Seeds Germinated",
     col = "lightgreen",
     breaks = 10)

# Expected value
expected_germination <- n_seeds * germination_rate
cat("Expected germination:", expected_germination, "seeds\n")
```

## Your Turn: Weather Probability 🌦️

```{r weather_exercise}
# If the probability of rain on any given day is 0.3,
# what's the probability of exactly 2 rainy days in a week?

prob_rain <- 0.3
days <- 7
rainy_days <- 2

# Calculate using binomial probability
prob_2_rainy <- dbinom(rainy_days, size = days, prob = prob_rain)
cat("Probability of exactly 2 rainy days:", round(prob_2_rainy, 4), "\n")
```
