In a two-tailed test, we are testing whether the sample mean is significantly different from the hypothesized mean (mu_0) in either direction (greater or smaller). Therefore, we compute the probability in both tails of the t-distribution and sum them. Since the t-distribution is symmetric, we only need to compute the probability of the test statistic in one tail and then double it to account for both tails. Using |t_stat| ensures we are always working with the positive magnitude, regardless of whether the test statistic is negative or positive."
