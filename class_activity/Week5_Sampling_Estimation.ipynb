It tells you not only about what you think the true value might be, but also how uncertain you are.\n",

This is crucial when you are trying to understand how extreme or typical a particular value is within a distribution. The z-score corresponds to the desired confidence level:\n",

Correspondingly, alpha would be 100% - 95% = 5% or 0.05. This 5% represents the risk you are taking that your interval might miss the true value.
