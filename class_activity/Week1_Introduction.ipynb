    "\n",
    "1. **Integer**: Whole numbers without decimals. Such as 1, 355, etc. Numbers like 2.5, 34.7 are NOT integers.\n",
    "2. **Numeric**: Numbers (both integers and decimals).\n",
    "3. **Character**: Text or string data.\n",
    "4. **Logical**: TRUE or FALSE values.\n",
    "5. **Factor**: Categorical data with levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find out the data type of a variable by using `class()` function. The output of this function is one word, specifying the data type or class.\n",
