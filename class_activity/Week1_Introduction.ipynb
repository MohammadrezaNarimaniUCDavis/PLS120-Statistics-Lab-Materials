    "\n",
    "1. Integer: Whole numbers without decimals. Such as 1, 355, etc. Numbers like 2.5, 34.7 are NOT integers.\n",
    "2. Numeric: Numbers (both integers and decimals).\n",
    "3. Character: Text or string data.\n",
    "4. Logical: TRUE or FALSE values.\n",
    "5. Factor: Categorical data with levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find out the data type of a variable by using class() function. The output of this funtion is one word, specifying the data type or class."
