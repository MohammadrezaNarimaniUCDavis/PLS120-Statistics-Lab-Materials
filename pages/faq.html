    <h2 class="section-title">Technical Issues</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: I'm having trouble installing R/RStudio. What should I do?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> First, make sure you install R before installing RStudio. If you continue to have problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check that you downloaded the correct version for your operating system</li>
            <li>Try RStudio Cloud as an alternative (no installation required)</li>
            <li>Visit office hours for hands-on help</li>
            <li>Contact IT support if it's a computer-specific issue</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: My R code isn't working. How can I get help?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> When seeking help with code:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Copy the exact error message</li>
            <li>Include the code that's causing the problem</li>
            <li>Describe what you expected to happen</li>
            <li>Post on the discussion forum or bring to office hours</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: Can I work on assignments using my tablet or phone?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> While RStudio Cloud can work on tablets, we strongly recommend using a computer with a full keyboard for coding assignments. The mobile experience is not optimal for statistical programming.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Assignments and Grading</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: How should I submit my homework assignments?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Submit assignments through Canvas. Include both your R code and output (you can copy-paste from RStudio or submit an R Markdown file). Make sure your code is well-commented and your answers are clearly labeled.</p>
        
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: What's the late policy for assignments?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Late assignments lose 10% per day late. Extensions may be granted for documented emergencies or health issues. Contact the instructor as soon as possible if you need an extension.</p>
        
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: Can I work with other students on assignments?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> You may discuss concepts and approaches with classmates, but all submitted work must be your own. Copying code or answers from others is considered academic dishonesty.</p>
        
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: How is the final project graded?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> The final project is graded on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Appropriateness of statistical methods (25%)</li>
            <li>Quality of analysis and interpretation (30%)</li>
            <li>Clarity of writing and presentation (25%)</li>
            <li>Creativity and depth of investigation (20%)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Statistical Concepts</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: When should I use a t-test vs. ANOVA?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Use a t-test when comparing means between two groups. Use ANOVA when comparing means among three or more groups. If you have only two groups, both methods will give the same p-value.</p>
        
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: What does "statistical significance" really mean?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Statistical significance (typically p < 0.05) means that if there were truly no effect, you would see results this extreme or more extreme less than 5% of the time by chance alone. It doesn't necessarily mean the effect is practically important.</p>
        
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: How do I know if my data meets the assumptions for a particular test?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> We'll cover assumption checking for each statistical test. Generally, you'll use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Histograms and Q-Q plots to check normality</li>
            <li>Residual plots to check homoscedasticity</li>
            <li>Levene's test for equal variances</li>
            <li>Scatterplots to check linearity (for regression)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="card-title">Q: What should I do if my data doesn't meet test assumptions?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transform your data (log, square root, etc.)</li>
            <li>Use non-parametric alternatives</li>
            <li>Use robust statistical methods</li>
            <li>Collect more data if sample size is small</li>
        </ul>
