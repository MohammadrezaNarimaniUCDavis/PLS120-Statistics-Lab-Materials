    "Today, we will be using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyze the results of an experiment involving pigs. A study was conducted to examine the effects of various feeding diets on the growth of pigs. Twenty male pigs of uniform age and weight were randomly assigned to four different experimental groups, with each group receiving a distinct diet. After two months of being raised on these respective diets, the body weights of the pigs were recorded.\n",
