    "Agronomists at UC Davis conducted a field experiment to evaluate the impact of a specific type of nitrogen fertilizer (N) on wheat yield, measured in kilograms per hectare. In the study, wheat was grown under two different conditions: one set of plots received N fertilizer at a rate of 50 kg/ha, while the other set served as a control group with no fertilizer applied.\n",
