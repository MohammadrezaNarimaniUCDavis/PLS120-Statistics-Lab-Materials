    "In this assignment, you will use the R programming language to simulate two common probability experiments: flipping a coin and rolling a six-sided dice. The goal is to simulate these experiments 50 times each, calculate the experimental probability of each outcome, and then compare it to the theoretical probability. Additionally, you will create discrete probability distributions for these outcomes and visualize them using R.\n",
