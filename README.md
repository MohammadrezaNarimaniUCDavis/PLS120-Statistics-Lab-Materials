## üí° Pro Tips for Success

### **üé≤ Probability Simulation Strategy**
1. **Use set.seed()** for reproducible random results
2. **Start with small samples** to understand concepts, then increase size
3. **Always verify your simulations** by checking total counts and probabilities
4. **Compare experimental to theoretical** probabilities to validate results

### **üìä Visualization Best Practices**
1. **Add meaningful titles and labels** to all probability plots
2. **Use appropriate scales** for probability (0 to 1) vs frequency displays
3. **Choose clear colors** to distinguish different outcomes
4. **Always interpret your results** in terms of probability theory

### **üîç Statistical Analysis Workflow**
1. **Simulate first, then analyze** - generate data before calculating probabilities
2. **Document your random seed** for reproducible experiments
3. **Verify probability sums** - discrete probabilities should sum to 1
4. **Consider sample size effects** - larger samples approach theoretical values
